# PLAN OF WORK
------------------------

1. Collect data of every employee (5 Images per employee with slight variations) according to the constraints mentioned in "Dataset Collection Parameter.pdf" document in the root of the repository.

2. Put the collected images (Not the meta files; they are only for reference) in the ./data directory and check whether the recognizer works well on it. If the performance of the recognizer degrades, try different approaches for recognition.

3. For the detection part, HOG or Haar Detectors are sufficient for the project. If a solution is required for the more open-ended problem statement, check the ./misc directory for details of models already tried for detection.
